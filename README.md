### Very briefly describe your understanding about one of the nextjs rendering methods (ssr,ssg, etc..).
SSR also known as Server Side Rendering is a faster way of rendering markup by fetching the data from the database to the server and bundle it to the client side, for every new request from the client side this cycle is repeated and the data is fetched from the database goes to the server and serves it as a bundle to the client which increases the render speed of pages and enhances the overall performance.
